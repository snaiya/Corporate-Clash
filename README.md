Elevator Pitch
Corporate Clash is a strategic business game where players run businesses selling Widgets to robot consumers. The game will be played over the course of 15 rounds, with each round comprising two phases:- Build Phase, Consumption Phase. In the Build Phase, the player will make purchase decisions involving buying land and deploying buildings. This phase will be followed by the Consumption Phase wherein the Consumer(bots) will flood the board making purchases dictated by the rules of the Consumer Group they belong to. At the end of each round, a Sales Report will be displayed displaying the summary of the player’s performance. Based on the summary the player has to draw conclusions and tweak the building strategy accordingly in order to achieve the assigned personal objective. (To gain a net profit of $2000 or greater).

Games Played:
Pocket City
SimCity
Roller Coaster Tycoon

Goal: 
The goal of the game is to build strategically in order to achieve a net profit of $2000 or greater over the course of 15 rounds.

Game Design:

Objectives:
Buy tiles from the allocated land permits and strategically construct buildings over them by identifying the consumer buying patterns.
Earn a profit amounting to $2000.

Game Flow:

Mechanism:
The player will be assigned multiple land permits in three different areas; Luxury, Alleway, Street. They need to achieve their global objective (earn a net profit of $2000 or more) which they have to achieve over the course of 15 rounds. 

Each round comprises of two phases:

Build Phase: In this phase, players use their money to purchase and deploy new buildings on the assigned land permits in their desired area.

Consumption Phase: Consumers purchase Widgets from players’ businesses, earning money for the players. Players take no action during this phase. Consumers automatically wander the city roads, visit shops, and make purchase decisions based on the pre-set, randomly generated rules of their Consumer Cluster.

Consumer Clusters: There are 2 Clusters each game, with 50% of the consumers every round belonging to exactly 1 cluster. Example cluster behaviors include: “I visit every shop I can in 10 seconds, then go back and buy the cheapest widget I found.”, “I visit shops until I find a widget that costs less than $10, then buys that and leave”, “I buy a widget from the first shop I see with a Billboard”.

At the end of every third round, players receive new land permits. Land permits let you build on more spaces. The unpurchased assigned land will no longer be available at the end of every third round.

Players’ net profit will be updated and checked at the end of each consumption phase. The winning condition will also be checked at the end of each consumption phase which is to cross a net profit of $2000.


Sales Report:

Sales Report will be generated after every consumption phase.
Shows the profit earned from each building built in each of the three sectors.
The net profit earned indicated the amount(profit) earned until now.
The profit earned after each round will get added to the player's bank balance. More profit amounts to more balance giving the player the ability to buy more land and construct more buildings.
